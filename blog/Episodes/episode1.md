Episode Number 1

We are entering a new age 

We can all feel it

The Age of Pisces is ending before our eyes.  

Those who control the Age of Pieces want to ensure that they also control in the coming Age of Aquarius. 

As an Aquarian and someone who can no longer relate the the emotional and sensitive Pisceans. 

Aquarians are needed more than ever to bring their imagination, their ideas that will eventually bring water/currency to the whole world. 

Topic that I will refer to include things that I'm quite well-versed in:

Software development and engineering
Rust and Open Source.
Monetary system dynamics
Etymology
Languages
Chess 

If you do decide to follow this blog, please try to go in order as I will work to have each espisode build on top of each other. 

I welcome you to the future with me.
